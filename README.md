> ## Project Description
> 
> ### Autocomplete website/widget
> 
> #### Description
> 
> - A website that enables users to quickly find and select words from a list of suggestions, as they type.
> - The list is dynamically generated from a pre-populated list of values (i.e. a dictionary file), leveraging searching and filtering.
> - A large data file is required to search through - consider the best data structure for this (e.g. `.txt` or `.json`).
> - Consider how implementation affects user experience and web performance (e.g. time to load and search through the data file).
> 
> #### Task
> 
> Your task is to build a site which will update as you type (an autocompleter), as per the description above.
> 
> #### Goals
> 
> 1. We expect **testing using jest** (test as many components as you can) and basic **front-end testing**. Please note that we expect tests on _pure functions_ and _not_ on the router or the DOM.
> 
> 2. Host your project on **heroku**, [see resource](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction).
> 
> 3. Use **module.exports** and **require** to break a single large server file into smaller modules.
> 
> 4. Consider what would be a good **server file structure** based on what we have discussed over the week.
> 
> #### Example
> 
> [Dwyl autocompleter](https://github.com/dwyl/autocomplete).
